# TaniHub QA Technical Test

- For QA Technical Test, here I will inform you that the answers to [QA Basic] and [SQL] questions are attached to the google sheet document in this repository. For other access, you can also use the following link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iZwPi8B5XohTnw27qnRJ-o7LeVgrIqH2A8bPjSr0S7w/edit?usp=sharing

- For the [API] problem, I also attached the file. To do this API Test, I used Postman for hit endpoints and assertions.

- For the [SQL] question, I have also attached the file. To do this SQL question, I use MySQL Workbench to execute a query from the sample database that was created.
